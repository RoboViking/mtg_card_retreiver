We want a tool to see if people have cards in their Archideckt collections based on a decklist.

## TODOs:
- [X] Check what Axel made.
- [ ] Create a gui which allows you to: 
   - [ ] Add/remove Archidekt collections
   - [ ] Import a decklist in text format
   - [ ] Display cards in your list that match cards in peoples collection
- [ ] (Test the scryfall api to retreive the images of cards)
